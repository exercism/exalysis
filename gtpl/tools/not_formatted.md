- Code formatting in Go is very important to the community. Take a look at `gofmt` and run it on your code. Your editor or IDE should be able to do this for you automatically:

    - Visual Studio Code has [great Go support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go)

    - Vim also has a [fantastic Go extension](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go)

    - [Jetbrains Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) is an entire IDE for Go
