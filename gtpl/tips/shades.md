- [50 Shades of Go](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/index.html) is a wonderful collection of traps, gotchas, and common mistakes in Go, orgnaised by experience level from beginner upwards. Some of these you may already know (unused variables!), many will be new to you. While you shouldn't necessarily read it from cover to cover, you'll find this a useful list to dip into and refer to from time to time.
