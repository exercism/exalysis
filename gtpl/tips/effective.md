- We may have mentioned it before, but [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) is really worth reading. It's all about how to write idiomatic Go and make the best use of the various features of the language. When you're first learning, parts of it won't mean much to you yet, but come back and read it again every so often; you'll get something new out of it every time.
