- There's a special font designed for programming, which can make editing Go code a nicer experience. It's called [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), and it has special symbols for some things in Go syntax, like '!=' and '<-'. It's free, and you can use it with any editor or terminal which supports fonts.
