- You are calling `math.Pow` here, which is a useful and flexible tool for computing powers generally. However, there's a special optimization you can do if you're just computing integer powers of 2: you can _bit-shift_ (move all the bits in the binary representation of the number left one place, which is equivalent to multiplying by 2). The operator for left shifting is `<<` or there are also functions in the `bits` package, e.g. `bits.RotateLeft64`. You can shift more than one place at once with `x << N`, which is equivalent to multiplying `x` by 2^N.
