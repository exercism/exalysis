- It's always a good idea to return as much information in an error message as you can. If you're testing for invalid arguments, it's helpful to return the actual arguments that caused the problem, using `fmt.Errorf`. However, it's worth knowing that this is a good deal slower than returning a string literal with `errors.New`. Usually, that price is well worth paying, but in a performance-critical situation, if this code is in the 'hot path', you may want to return `errors.New` instead.
