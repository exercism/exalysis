- I see you are using `+` to concatenate the string. That is perfectly legit! If you didn't know about the `fmt` package, check it out. It can do lots of things related to string formatting, including concatenating strings.

    (Using `+` is probably the right choice here. I just wanted you to know about `fmt`, because it's awesome, and you'll be using it a lot.)
